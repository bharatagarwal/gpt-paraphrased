## Preface
The title alone reveals a philosophical conundrum at hand. No apologies for the philosophical discourse, aware as I am that scientists, engineers, mathematicians often dismiss it. Rather, this preface serves as a defense of this chosen route.

Man, as far as we know, has always pondered his own existence, his surroundings, the meaning of life. We've inherited countless myths from our forebears, tales of why and how gods crafted man and the cosmos. These I'll call *theological explanations*. Their shared trait – no incentive to question the state of affairs, instead we receive primarily a narration of creation as the gods saw fit.

Philosophy was born when man commenced to question beyond this theological sphere. An early manifestation was the philosophers' assertion that the world is composed of earth, fire, water, and air. They were probably admonished that the gods orchestrated things this way and they ought to cease their worries.

From these primitive attempts to explain phenomena came the development of philosophy and our contemporary science. It's not that science elucidates “why” things are – gravity doesn't clarify why things fall – but science provides so many “how” details that it creates an illusion of understanding the “why.” To clarify, it is through a labyrinth of interconnected specifics that science appears to justify “why” the universe exists as it does.

Mathematics is our principal tool for conducting the rigorous reasoning required by science. Indeed, one might define mathematics as the mental instrument designed specifically for this task. Many a soul throughout history has asked what this title questions, “Why is mathematics so irrationally potent?” We're essentially observing more of the logical facet and less of the material aspect of the universe and its operations.

Mathematicians engaged in the foundations of mathematics primarily focus on the system's self-consistency and constraints. They don't seem to trouble themselves with why the world apparently accepts a logical explanation. I find myself in a position reminiscent of the early Greek philosophers who mused over the material aspect, and my insights on the logical facet are likely no better than theirs. But we must embark somewhere, at some point, to interpret the phenomenon that the world seems to adhere to a logical pattern echoing mathematics, that mathematics is the lingua franca of science and engineering.

After sketching the primary structure, I had to contemplate the optimal method to convey my thoughts and convictions to my audience. History tells that I am not always triumphant in this endeavor. I concluded that the following initial remarks might assist.

In several aspects, this discussion is deeply theoretical. I find it necessary to skim over various theories pertaining to the broad activity labeled mathematics, and delve into select areas. Moreover, there are numerous theories concerning applications. Hence, to a degree, this leads to a theory of theories. It might surprise you that I will adopt the experimenter's stance in this discourse. Disregard what the theories are purported to be, or what you conceive they should be, or even what experts insist they are; let's adopt the scientific approach and scrutinize what they truly are. I am cognizant that much of my discourse, particularly regarding the nature of mathematics, will rankle many mathematicians. My experimental approach contradicts their mindset and preconceptions. Let it be so!

The spark for this paper was ignited by a similarly titled work, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences”, by E. P. Wigner. It will be observed that I have omitted a segment of the title, and for those familiar with it, I have not duplicated much of his content (I feel no need to attempt to enhance his exposition). Conversely, I will devote considerably more effort to unravel the implicit query in the title. Yet, even when all my explanations have been exhausted, a significant remnant remains, leaving the question essentially unaddressed.

In his thoughtful treatise, Wigner probes the profound depth of mathematics in the realm of physical sciences. I'll refer to my own trials, closer to the craft of engineering. My maiden real-world encounter with the predictive might of mathematics traced back to the design of atomic bombs during the World War II. The primitive relay computers' output harmonized with the events of the initial test shot at Almagordo - a phenomenon that puzzled me. There existed no opportunity for small-scale experiments to validate our computations. Further encounters with guided missiles echoed the same enigma: the tangible world faithfully reflected our mathematical predictions.

## Echoes in Engineering
During my tenure at the Bell System, I dealt with a myriad of mathematical computations ranging from telephone computations to the stability of complex communication systems. No area was left untouched by the allure of mathematical precision. The glamour of transistor research, the thrill of space flight, and the complexity of computer design all yielded to the mastery of mathematical manipulations. It was not an isolated incident. The tale of Maxwell's equations and radio waves, or the creation of the special theory of relativity due to the lack of invariance in Newton's equations are testaments to the power of mathematics. Unsurprisingly, the same mathematical concepts make appearances in entirely unexpected contexts. 

The puzzlingly simple nature of mathematics has often been highlighted as the cornerstone of its application in physics. Even in the heart of mathematics, the simplicity is striking: basic algebraic equations mirror the fundamental geometric entities, thereby making analytic geometry a practical reality. It is puzzling how this simple human invention - mathematics - can render itself so vital in a multitude of situations. In light of these mathematical triumphs, there is an ongoing push to mold all the sciences into mathematical frameworks. 

From Pythagoras to Kepler and Galileo, the echo of this sentiment resounds: "Mathematics is the way to understand the universe." Newton's laws of motion, combined with the law of gravitation, present perhaps the most compelling example of mathematics' improbable effectiveness in science. Not only did they predict known planetary positions but also accurately forecasted unknown celestial movements. It seems that laws, founded on a limited set of observations, manage to maintain their relevance and accuracy far beyond their original scope. 

## Unfathomable Accuracy
In my thirty years of applying mathematics in the industrial sector, the predictions that I made based on it never ceased to amaze me. The accuracy of these predictions, borne out of human-made mathematics, seemed uncanny, almost as if the universe was in cahoots with our mathematical equations. The answer, however, lies not in the universe conforming to our predictions but rather in mathematics providing a trustworthy representation of the universe. It leaves me wondering, how can simple mathematics predict so much?

I could bore you with an endless list of examples proving the baffling efficacy of mathematics, but I'll refrain. Instead, let's assume the list of successes is long and filled with many a spectacle - from predicting new planets to novel physical phenomena and artefacts. With the limited time we have, I'd rather devote it to exploring what Wigner avoided: trying to offer at least some partial answers to the question subtly proposed by the title.

## Essence
Rather than furnishing a formal definition, I intend to illustrate the concept of mathematics by exploring key aspects that construct its backbone. The celebrated book by Courant and Robbins titled “What is Mathematics?” provides numerous examples instead of a concrete definition. Here, we delve deeper than they did into these significant facets of mathematics as I perceive them.

The starting point to answer the question of what mathematics is, is the beginning itself. Our exploration leads us back to the prehistoric period, the cradle of mathematics, which had four major facets. The ability to weave lengthy strings of intricate reasoning that to this day signifies mathematics was the first. Geometry, the second, gave way to the concepts of continuity and subsequently, topology. Thirdly, we have numbers that paved the way for arithmetic, algebra, and more. Finally, the role of aesthetic taste in modern mathematics cannot be overlooked. It’s important to note that different fields within mathematics boast different kinds of beauty.

Any claims made about the earliest history of mathematics are speculative at best, considering the lack of concrete evidence. It seems likely though, that primitive life incorporated an understanding of cause and effect, primarily for survival purposes. The moment this observation escalates into a sequence of, “If this, then that, leading to this...,” we are on our way to defining the first aspect of mathematics – extensive chains of precise reasoning. However, I am skeptical that Darwinian survival of the fittest alone could have selected for this specific ability required for mathematics and science.

The origins of geometry can be traced back to body adornment for various purposes including religious rites, social functions, and courtship, along with the decoration of walls, utensils, clothes, etc. This notion brings us back to the fourth aspect, aesthetic taste, which forms the bedrock of mathematics. Contrary to popular belief that the Greeks claim geometry was a product of the Egyptians' need to survey land after each Nile River flood, I believe aesthetics played a more significant role, and utility had a less immediate influence.

## Genesis of Numbers
Numbers, the third pillar of mathematics, emerged from the basic action of counting. As once stated by a renowned mathematician, “God made the integers, man did the rest”. The fact that integers are so elementary that they are expected to exist in any form of intelligent life in the universe is truly astonishing. What fascinates me is how counting was made possible through the abstraction of integers. Is it not remarkable that 6 sheep plus 7 sheep make 13 sheep; that 6 stones plus 7 stones make 13 stones? The universal applicability of such a simple concept as a number highlights the inexplicably effective nature of mathematics.

Over time, integers, these counting numbers, were employed to measure lengths with respect to a standard unit. However, it quickly became evident that in some cases, an exact integer could not measure the length, thus leading to the invention of fractions. These fractions were not counting numbers but measuring numbers. With their frequent usage, fractions were found to adhere to the same manipulation rules as integers, offering the advantage of enabling division in all situations. A key feature of fractions is their density, implying that an infinite number of fractions could be inserted between any two fractions. However, this expansion of the concept of number necessitates relinquishing the idea of the subsequent number.

The concept of zero, the cipher, evolved as a byproduct of counting and arithmetic operations. The Mayans and Indians are credited with understanding and incorporating zero into their numerical systems before anyone else. Following fractions, zero, and negative numbers were realized, drastically changing the panorama of mathematics.

The next juncture in the mathematical journey is the encounter with irrational numbers. It occurred when it was discovered that the diagonal of a unit square could not be expressed as a fraction. This led to the understanding that not all lengths could be represented by fractions, ushering in the era of irrational numbers.

Imaginary numbers, the numbers that result when taking the square root of a negative number, were the next development. These numbers, initially dismissed as nonsense, eventually found their place within the grand design of mathematics, revealing an additional aesthetic dimension to this field.

## Complexity
As mathematics expanded, it continued to grow in complexity. With the introduction of each new concept, mathematics moved away from simple counting to the formation of elaborate and abstract systems. Every new aspect brought forth fresh challenges that required the reconstruction and readjusting of existing systems to accommodate the new concepts.

Despite the complexity, the innate beauty of mathematics lies in its ability to adapt and evolve while retaining its core essence. The aesthetics of mathematics is a profound characteristic that continually inspires mathematicians to delve deeper and explore its uncharted depths. The universality of mathematics, its adaptability, and its ability to encapsulate complexity within simplicity, together make mathematics an inexplicably effective tool for understanding the universe.

To succinctly define mathematics seems an insurmountable task. It is much more than mere counting and calculations; it is a complex language that describes the universe and a tool that allows us to navigate our world. The question "What is Mathematics?" is as profound as the field itself, and the exploration of this question continues, just as the exploration of mathematics does.

## The Legacy of Pythagoras
Pythagoras, revered as the first to prove the irrational relation between a square's side and its diagonal, ignited a significant revolution in Greek mathematics. Until this revelation, the discrete number system and continuous geometry coexisted in harmony. This crisis of incommensurability spurred the Euclidean approach to mathematics.

Interestingly, the Greeks attempted to instill rigor into mathematics by substituting the ambiguities of numbers with what they perceived as more reliable geometry. This shift was consequential for Euclid, leading to an abundance of number theory and algebra presented geometrically in 'The Elements'. 

## Extension of the Number System
We, unlike the early Greeks, have embraced the real number system, positing that there exists a number representing the length of a unit square's diagonal. Such an acceptance marked the evolution of the rational number system to include algebraic numbers – all out of a simple wish to measure lengths.

Yet, calculating a circle's circumference relative to its diameter introduced us to pi, a non-algebraic number, prompting the consideration of transcendental numbers. These gradually integrated into the number system, expanding the earlier concepts of numbers. Nevertheless, the integration of transcendental numbers into the number system remains uncomfortable territory for many.

Further adjustments to the number system welcomed zero and negative numbers. However, this expansion necessitated the forfeiture of division for zero alone. Although the real number system may not rest on a solid, logical, and straightforward foundation, familiarity has bred acceptance, if not contempt.

## The Mysteries of Zeno’s Paradoxes and the Real Number System
The real number system, despite our common understanding of it, remains an enigma to many of us. We are reminded by Zeno’s paradoxes that our understanding of the connection between the discrete number system and the continuous line is far from complete.

While some mathematicians question the existence of the conventional real number system, a few computer theorists recognize only “the computable numbers”.

The historical narrative tells us that Cardan was the first to comprehend complex numbers. He realized that the same formal operations on the symbols for complex numbers yielded meaningful results, thereby extending the real number system to the complex number system.

The problem of integrating real functions along the real line reportedly drove Cauchy to the theory of complex variables. By diverting the integration path into the complex plane, he found a solution to real integration problems.

Several sunrises ago, I found myself imparting knowledge on complex variables, a journey that never fails to leave me awestruck. It's as if the universe was constructed from a blueprint of complex numbers - their fingerprints evident in quantum mechanics, electrical circuitry, and electromagnetic fields. 

## From Counting to Comprehending 

Our journey from the simplicity of counting - an act seemingly blessed by the divine - to a complex number system is as astounding as it is practical. We've stretched our understanding of numbers, often for the sheer aesthetic pleasure of it, sometimes forfeiting certain properties of preceding number systems. The result is a mathematical structure of tremendous potency - a witness to this is the successful solution of discrete number theory problems using complex variables. 

This narrative demonstrates how mathematical extensions, generalizations, and abstractions thread together to form an expanding tapestry of understanding. Each new exploration subtly modifies the existing definitions, leading to a fascinating predicament - old proofs of theorems become false. The proofs no longer fit within the framework of the new definitions. Yet, almost as if by magic, the theorems hold true - requiring merely a touch-up of the proofs. 

A prime example is Euclid's 'The Elements, where we found it necessary to introduce new postulates (or axioms, if you will) to comply with the evolving standards of proof. Astonishingly, not a single theorem across the thirteen volumes is deemed false today. 

Our understanding of mathematics, it seems, is not as elementary teachers paint it to be. It is something more - something else. This 'else' comes to life once we move beyond the constraints of axioms and postulates. The introduction of new concepts, like triangles, marks the first significant leap. The pursuit of appropriate concepts and definitions is the heart of true mathematical exploration.

## Proofs and Theorems

Traditionally, geometry sets the stage with a theorem, seeking its proof. But a realization around the 1850s revealed a reverse approach - it's often the proof that births the theorem. We discover what we can prove and then sift through the proof to grasp what we've indeed proved! This discovery led to 'proof-generated theorems.

One notable instance is the concept of 'uniform convergence'. Cauchy's theorem, stating that a convergent series of continuous terms converges to a continuous function, was found to have a flaw when faced with Fourier series of continuous functions converging to a discontinuous limit. The error was identified and rectified by revising the theorem's hypothesis to "a uniformly convergent series."

## Foundations or Battlements?

A recent fascination in mathematical circles is the study of its foundations, which, in my view, are better seen as the battlements of mathematics. It's an intriguing field, yet the core findings in mathematics remain untouched by these investigations - we simply can't afford to discard substantial parts of mathematics, no matter how illogical they appear in light of these studies.

I hope to have shed light on the fact that mathematics isn't as stagnant as often perceived - it's continually evolving. Even if I were to perfectly define it today, that definition might be obsolete by tomorrow. Our notions of rigor are no exception. Like the scientific understanding that we're not the center of the universe, it's hard for me to accept that we've reached the pinnacle of mathematical rigor. Consequently, we can't be entirely certain of our current proofs.

In conclusion, one might say:

> The postulates of mathematics were not etched

There exists an import to underlining this. We commence with a nebulous thought, then spawn multiple axioms, slowly congealing into one definitive set. In this stringent axiom-based manner, the original thought is supplanted by the definitions derived from these postulates. Such process complicates any further development, potentially putting the brakes on mathematical evolution. The approach isn't inherently flawed, but the whimsicality of it ought to be realized. We should stand ready to recalibrate these axioms when necessity demands.

Crafted by human intellect, Mathematics stands prone to regular alterations. Likely, the very seeds of this discipline were imposed on us. But as the example I've previously elucidated, we see that even in the formation of a rudimentary concept like a number, our decisions to expand have been governed only partially by necessity. Often, I believe, it's the aesthetic allure that drives us. We've strived to sculpt Mathematics into a coherent, enchanting entity, resulting in an astonishing multitude of successful real-world applications.

## Theorems and Postulates: A Dissent from Conventional Observation

The notion that theorems spring from the foundation of axioms doesn't align with plain observation. For instance, if the Pythagorean theorem were detected to not emanate from the postulates, we would once again embark on a journey to amend these axioms till it held true. Euclid’s postulates originated from the Pythagorean theorem, the sequence wasn't reversed. For over three decades, I've maintained that if you arrived in my quarters proving that Cauchy's theorem was incorrect, I would indeed be intrigued. However, I am convinced that ultimately, we would tweak the suppositions till the theorem stood true. Therefore, a multitude of mathematical results stand independently of the foundational assumptions and their proofs.

How do we adjudicate, in times of a mathematical "crisis", what portions to retain and what to discard? Practicality serves as a major yardstick. However, often it's the practicality in producing more mathematics that takes precedence over real-world applications. Thus concludes my rumination on mathematics.

# Partial explanations
## We see what we look for

If a man dons blue glasses, he expects the world to bear a bluish hue. It's no surprise. I plan to expose this principle in the realm of modern science, breaking down some cherished, fervent beliefs along the way. Bear with me.

I used scientists as an example for good reason. Pythagoras, to me, stands as the first great physicist. His revelation—that we exist in a mathematical space known as $L_{2}$, wherein the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides of a right-angled triangle—stands testament to this. It was not an outcome of geometric postulates. Rather, it shaped them.

### Walking in Galileo's Shoes

In order to gain deeper insights, I sometimes attempt to place myself in the minds of the greats. I did this with Galileo, hoping to understand how he unearthed the law of falling bodies. I strive to capture their mindset, their method of thinking.

Galileo was a master of dialectic, well-versed in scholastic argumentation. He was skilled in debating all sides of a question, far more proficiently than most of us today. Imagine him, sat there, with a heavy ball in one hand and a light one in the other. He would have mused, “It's clear that heavy objects fall faster than light ones. Aristotle said as much.” But being a questioning mind, he wondered what would happen if a falling body split in two mid-air. Would each piece slow down to its natural speed? What if they touched? Would they speed up, now being one object? And what if they were tied together? When would two pieces be considered one?

The more he pondered—and the more you ponder—the more absurd the question of when two bodies become one appears. There's simply no rational answer to how a body determines its own weight—whether it is a single piece or many. Given that falling bodies must behave in some way, the only reasonable conclusion is that they all fall at the same rate—unless other forces interfere. I suspect that Galileo arrived at his conclusion less through experimentation than through clear, critical thinking, scholastic reasoning.

Despite textbooks often presenting the law of falling bodies as an experimental observation, I insist that it's a logical law, born from the way we think.

### From Kepler to Newton

While textbooks generally claim that Newton deduced the inverse square law from Kepler's laws (or the other way around), if you believe in energy conservation and reside in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, how else could a symmetric central-force field diminish? Experiments to measure the exponent are largely efforts to confirm our existence in a Euclidean space, not to test the inverse square law itself.

### The Uncertainty Principle and Fourier Integrals

If these examples don't convince, consider the much-praised law of our times, the uncertainty principle. While writing a book on Digital Filters, I pondered why I should analyze everything using Fourier integrals. Why were they the perfect tools for the job? As it turns out, complex exponentials are the eigenfunctions of translation. If you desire time invariance (as physicists and engineers do, expecting the same outcome from experiments conducted today or tomorrow), you are led to these functions. Similarly, linearity leads to these eigenfunctions. In quantum mechanics, the quantum states are absolutely additive; they are not just a convenient linear approximation. Thus, trigonometric functions become the needed eigenfunctions in both digital filter theory and quantum mechanics, among others.

The application of eigenfunctions opens a pathway to representing varying functions, initially in a countable sequence, and then in an uncountable sequence through the means of the Fourier series and the Fourier integral. A statement of significance in the realm of Fourier integrals asserts the product of the variability of a function and its transform to exceed a set constant, defined by 1/27 in one such notation. Such a statement implies an uncertainty principle embedded within any linear, time invariant system. The magnitude of Planck's constant depends on the intricate identification of variables with integrals, yet the inequality inevitably arises.

### Our Perception of Physical Constants

In another illustration of what has been deemed a physical discovery, only to reveal our own input, one turns to the uneven distribution of physical constants. A random physical constant is more likely to lead with a digit of 1, 2, or 3, this probability amounting to approximately 60%. In contrast, the probability of leading digits being 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 totals to about 40%. This pattern extends to a range of numbers, including the distribution of the coefficients of a power series with a single singularity on the circle of convergence. A meticulous examination unveils the root of this phenomenon in our utilization of numbers.

From these four diverse nontrivial circumstances, it becomes clear that our mathematical tools often shape the original phenomenon, as opposed to the real world. This defies much of conventional teaching, yet consider this claim thoroughly. One may argue that experimental results forced this model upon us, yet contemplating the given examples may lead to unsettling thoughts. These are not randomly chosen theories, but fundamental to physics.

### Einstein's Approach

In contemporary times, Einstein championed the simplicity of the laws of physics, and utilized mathematics to the extent of gaining a reputation as a mathematician. Scrutinizing his special theory of relativity pape, one finds similarities with the methodology of a scholastic philosopher. Einstein had a preconceived notion of what the theory should resemble, and he navigated through the theories utilizing mathematical tools, rather than actual experiments. His faith in the correctness of the relativity theories was such that experimental results held little significance for him, stating that they were destined to align with the theories or the experiments were flawed. Many concur that the two relativity theories stand on philosophical rather than experimental foundations.

This brings us to the initial implied query regarding the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. We engage with situations equipped with an intellectual apparatus that often constrains what we discover. It is as straightforward, yet as dreadful, as that. The notion that the foundation of science rests solely on real-world experiments is a half-truth. Eddington ventured further, proclaiming that a sufficiently wise mind could deduct all of physics. While I am not entirely endorsing his claim, I propose that a surprising proportion can indeed be deducted. To exemplify this idea, Eddington provided a charming parable: "Some men went fishing in the sea with a net, and upon examining what they caught they concluded that there was a minimum size to the fish in the sea."

## We select the kind of mathematics to use
Sometimes, our old mathematical tools fail us. Scalars were inadequate to explain forces, so we crafted a new mathematical language—vectors. Tensors followed suit. In a recent book I penned, ordinary integers served as labels, and real numbers represented probabilities. Yet, all other arithmetic and algebraic calculations in the text obeyed one simple rule:

$$i+1=0$$

Thus, my second argument rests on the notion that we tailor the mathematics to the situation at hand. It's a fallacy to believe that one mathematical toolset is universally applicable.

## Science in fact answers comparatively few problems
We often erroneously believe that science holds the answers to the majority of our questions. Since time immemorial, humanity has grappled with concepts of Truth, Beauty, and Justice. Yet, I see no substantial contributions from science in these discussions, nor do I anticipate them in the near future. As long as we persist in a mathematics that considers the whole as merely the sum of its parts, we're unlikely to wield mathematics effectively in addressing these perennial queries.

More broadly, a vast majority of our worldly experiences aren't confined to the realms of science or mathematics. Furthermore, drawing from Gédel’s theorem, we surmise that pure symbolic manipulation has its bounds—defining the limits of mathematics. Scientists have operated on a leap of faith, assuming the world's complexities can be dissected by simple mathematical tools. If we consider the multitude of unanswered questions, our scientific victories don't seem as monumental.

## The evolution of man provided the model
I've touched upon human evolution before, noting how the precursors of our ability to weave intricate chains of logic must have existed even in primitive lifeforms. Some theorists assert that Darwinian evolution favored those lifeforms that held the most accurate internal representations of reality—'accuracy' serving their survival and propagation. There's a ring of truth to this hypothesis. We humans can comfortably comprehend scales comparable to our own, but we falter when grappling with the extremely minute or colossal.

Just as dogs perceive smells and sounds beyond our sensory reach, so too exist light wavelengths we can't see and flavors we can't taste. Considering these limitations of our brains, the statement, "There might be thoughts we can't think," shouldn't startle us. Evolution could potentially have impeded our thinking in some areas, creating a realm of unthinkable thoughts.

If we consider that modern science has only spanned around 400 years and assuming 3 to 5 generations per century, there have been a maximum of 20 generations since Newton and Galileo. Using 4,000 years as a broad age of science, we get a ceiling of 200 generations. Given these numbers, I'm inclined to believe that evolution can account for only a fraction of mathematics' unreasonably effective nature.


## Conclusion
After reflecting on all these points, I must concede that mathematics wields an unreasonable effectiveness. The explanations I've offered collectively fall short of fully accounting for this phenomenon. It's our task—I mean, yours, mostly—to persevere in understanding why the logical element of science, predominantly mathematics, has emerged as the prime tool to understand our universe. I confess that my explanations might lack the elegance of the early Greeks, who ascribed the universe's material nature to earth, fire, water, and air. The logical aspect of the universe's nature demands further exploration.
