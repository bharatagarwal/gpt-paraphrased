- Title: A Mathematician's Lament by Paul Lockhart
- Content: 
    - A musician has a nightmare where music education is mandatory and reduced to memorizing sheet music and theory, with no creativity or appreciation for the art form.
    - Similarly, a painter has a nightmare where painting education is reduced to memorizing colors and applicators, with no actual painting until high school.
    - The current system of mathematics education is compared to this nightmare, with a focus on memorizing formulas and procedures rather than creative problem-solving and exploration.
    - Mathematics is described as an art form, with mathematicians creating patterns of ideas and asking simple and elegant questions about imaginary creations.
    - The beauty and creativity of mathematics is lost in the current education system, which reduces it to a set of facts and procedures to be memorized.
