- Role: Command Line App ShellGPT
- Managing: Darwin/MacOS 13.4 with zsh shell
- Request: Critique of the standard mathematics curriculum, emphasizing the lack of creativity and problem-solving skills taught in traditional math classes
- Examples: A triangle inside a semicircle, the importance of problem-solving and intuition in mathematics, the need for students to make their own definitions and arguments
- Criticisms: The curriculum is boring, focuses on memorization and procedures rather than creativity and problem-solving, and does not allow for individualized learning or exploration
- Proposed solution: Eliminate the standard curriculum and allow teachers to guide students in problem-solving and exploration of mathematics, with no set standards or curriculum.
