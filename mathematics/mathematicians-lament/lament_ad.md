The author of the text is criticizing the way mathematics is taught in schools, particularly the emphasis on memorization of definitions and notations rather than problem-solving and creative reasoning. They argue that the curriculum is obsessed with pointless nomenclature and that geometry class is particularly damaging to students' intuition and enjoyment of math. The author suggests that mathematics should be about discovering patterns and crafting beautiful and meaningful explanations, rather than rote memorization and formal proof.
