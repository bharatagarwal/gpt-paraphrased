- Request: Discussing "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics" by R.W. Hamming.
- Prologue: Philosophy and science have developed from man's curiosity about the world. Mathematics is the main tool for scientific reasoning. The question of why mathematics is so effective is a philosophical one.
- The Effectiveness of Mathematics: Mathematics has been successfully used in predicting real-world phenomena in various fields, including atomic bomb design, guided missiles, telecommunications, space flight, and computer design. The same mathematical concepts are found in unexpected connections, and the simplicity of mathematics is remarkable. There is a trend towards making each science mathematical.
- What is Mathematics?: Mathematics has four major faces: long chains of close reasoning, geometry, number, and artistic taste. Geometry arose from the problems of decorating the human body and surfaces. Numbers arose from counting and are fundamental to the universe. Fractions were developed for measuring and obey the same rules for manipulations as integers.
