# Polya's Techniques for Problem Solving

In 1945, George Polya's renowned book, *How To Solve It*, emerged. Over a million copies sold, translated into 17 languages. The book presents four fundamental principles of problem solving.

## 1. Understand the Problem

Seemingly obvious, yet often overlooked, fully grasping a problem is vital. Polya urged teachers to ask students:

- Do you comprehend the problem's terminology?
- What must you determine or demonstrate?
- Can you rephrase the problem?
- Would a picture or diagram aid your understanding?

## 2. Devise a Plan

Polya emphasized numerous valid approaches to problem solving. With practice, selecting strategies becomes simpler. A few strategies include:

- Guess and check
- Create an orderly list
- Remove possibilities
- Apply symmetry
- Examine special cases
- Employ direct reasoning
- Solve an equation
- Search for patterns
- Draw a picture
- Tackle a simpler problem
- Utilize a model
- Reverse engineer
- Implement a formula
- Exercise ingenuity

## 3. Carry Out the Plan

Typically easier than formulating a plan, executing it requires diligence and patience. Persist with your chosen strategy, but if it falters, adopt another. This is how mathematics unfolds, even for experts.

## 4. Look Back

Polya advised reflecting on completed work, evaluating successes and failures. This introspection enables the anticipation of which strategies will be effective for future problems.
