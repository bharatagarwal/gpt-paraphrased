# Foreword

### A Discovery of Passionate Lament
In late 2007, I was given a 25-page typewritten document: A Mathematician's Lament. A work of Paul Lockhart, a mathematics teacher, its content had been wandering erratically within the mathematics education community since 2002 but remained unpublished. I found myself enamored with his words, which deserved a wider audience. I tracked down the author and devoted an entire issue of my online column, "Devlin's Angle," to reproducing the essay in its original form.

### A Spark Igniting a Firestorm
Upon introducing A Mathematician's Lament in my March 2008 column, I praised it as one of the finest critiques of current K-12 mathematics education. The response was a firestorm, resonating around the world. Requests for reproduction and translation rights flooded in, and this very volume emerged in the process.

It was not that Lockhart's points were new or that they had not been made before. What set them apart was his eloquence and the fervor he infused into his writing. This was not simply good writing; it was heartfelt greatness.

### A Perspective Few Can Share
A Mathematician's Lament, including this expanded book version, is an opinion piece. Lockhart holds strong views on mathematics education and argues vigorously for his approach. What distinguishes him, besides his captivating writing, is his unique perspective: a rare individual who began as a research mathematician, taught at universities, and later discovered his true calling in K-12 teaching.

### The Weight of Lockhart's Words
I believe this book, like the original essay, should be essential reading for anyone involved in mathematics education, parents of school-aged children, and those responsible for mathematics teaching. Though you may not concur with Lockhart's words, you should read and reflect upon them. A Mathematician's Lament is an undeniable landmark in mathematics education. I won't tell you how to react, but I will say this: I would have loved Paul Lockhart as my school mathematics teacher.
